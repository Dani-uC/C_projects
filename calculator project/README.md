# Calculator.c
Console based calculator built from C 
it receives input as an array of characters, check for syntax errors and parses it into a doubly linked list.
the double linked list i resolved according to the BODMAS rule ,
the claculator is kind of an abandoned project because I haven't implemented the functionality of parentheses.
